# Introduction
This section provides an overview of the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) provided by the Social Services IP.
These KPIs are clustered on the categories shown below:

School measures
- Measure levels of school attendance level of absence
- Measure the pupils exclusions
- Measure school moves (pupils changing schools frequential)

Social Services measures
- Measure social services plans
- Measure the social services assessment time scales
- Measure 'front-door' activity

However, due to the Social Services data model collection of data at a granular level, plus its flexibility and extensibility, additional KPI can be designed and implemented on the current version of the data model.

# Measure levels of school attendance level of absence

## Attendance
### Definition of the KPI metrics
The definition of the metrics for attendance are listed below:
Attendance should capture SEN and EHCP. Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per School? Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per year group? Answer is yes.
Data Period per week.  
### Definition / Methodology / Overview
A pupils level of school attendance is expressed as a percentage of sessions present; a pupil’s level of schoolabsence is expressed as a percentage of sessions absent. Adding both percentages together will alwaysequal 100%. Reporting levels of school attendance as opposed to absence is often seen as a more positiveway of reporting. This said, deficit and risk models will usually focus on school absence. There are typically190 days in a school academic year. Each day is split into two sessions – morning and afternoon. A pupil willachieve a mark for each session that they are present. A pupil attending school at a level of between 95 and100% has typically had less than 10 days absence in a year. If the total number of sessions of possibleattendance is x, then the number of sessions a pupil is present is y, then the attendance is equal to((y/x)*100).There are codes pertaining to sessions missed which we will need to consider.

## Absence
### Definition of the KPI metrics
The definition of the metrics for attendance are listed below:
Attendance should capture SEN and EHCP. Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per School? Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per year group? Answer is yes.
Data Period per week.

# Measure the pupils exclusions
## Exclusion (Fixed Period)
### Definition of the KPI metrics
The definition of the metrics for attendance are listed below:
Attendance should capture SEN and EHCP. Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per School? Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per year group? Answer is yes.
Data Period per week.
### Definition / Methodology / Overview
Fixed Period Exclusion (FPE) from school means that a pupil is not allowed in school for a set number of daysfor disciplinary reasons. Fixed period exclusion is one of the sanctions a school can give if a child doessomething that is against the school's behaviour policy (the school rules). There are codes pertaining tosessions missed which we will need to consider.

## Exclusion (Permanent) 
### Definition of the KPI metrics
The definition of the metrics for attendance are listed below:
Attendance should capture SEN and EHCP. Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per School? Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per year group? Answer is yes.
Data Period per week.
### Definition / Methodology / Overview
Permanent Exclusion (PE) is the most serious sanction a school can give if a child does something that isagainst the school's behaviour policy (the school rules). It means that the child is no longer allowed toattend the school and their name will be removed from the school roll. There are codes pertaining tosessions missed which we will need to consider.


# Measure school moves (pupils changing schools frequential)
## School Moves
### Definition of the KPI metrics
The definition of the metrics for attendance are listed below:
Attendance should capture SEN and EHCP. Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per School? Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per year group? Answer is yes.
Data Period per week.
### Definition / Methodology / Overview
Movement of schools by a pupil can be referred to as either pupil mobility or stability. For the purposes ofthis project, the focus will be on mobility, which is defined as the total movement in and out of schools bypupils other than at the usual times of joining and leaving, for example at the start or end of an academicyear. We need to include EHE as subset.


# Measure social services plans
## Number of Child in Need Plans
### Definition of the KPI metrics
The definition of the metrics for attendance are listed below:
Attendance should capture SEN and EHCP. Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per School? Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per year group? Answer is yes.
Data Period per week.  
### Definition / Methodology / Overview
A Child in Need Plan contains the support being provided to a child (and their family) by Children’s SocialCare and includes information on which agencies will provide the required support and what the expectedoutcomes are. Draft plans must be included in this as at number.

## Number of Child Protection Plans
### Definition of the KPI metrics
The definition of the metrics for attendance are listed below:
Attendance should capture SEN and EHCP. Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per School? Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per year group? Answer is yes.
Data Period per week.
### Definition / Methodology / Overview
The purpose of a CP Plan is to devise and implement a plan which leads to lasting improvements in thechild's safety and overall well being. CP Plans should ensure that children who are likely to suffer significantharm are protected and that they and their families are receiving the services necessary to bring about therequired changes in the family situation. As an additional subset, it would be useful to capture if the childhas been the subject of a previous CP Plan.

## Number of Child Looked After

The definition of the metrics for attendance are listed below:
Attendance should capture SEN and EHCP. Answer is yes.
Attendance should be measured per School? Answer is yes.

### Definition / Methodology / Overview
An assessment is an assessment of the needs of each child and follows a referral into Children's Social Care.Number of assessments COMPLETED in the data period - this is an important distinction from the previousmeasure and is required to support the following measure.

### Definition / Methodology / Overview
A referral is a request for services to be provided by Children's Social Care. Number of referrals recorded viathe single integrated front door by all agencies for all presenting issues. Some children may have more thanone referral recorded (although unlikely) per data period and so need to capture on a per child basis (i.e.distinct).
